## File Explanations

### web.php
**Description:**
   The `routes/web.php` file defines the web routes for your application. It maps URLs to controller actions or directly returns views. This is where you define how the application responds to browser-based requests.

### .env
**Description:**
   The `.env` file contains environment-specific configuration variables, such as database credentials, app keys, and mail settings. It should never be committed to version control. Instead, use `.env.example` as a template for other environments.
